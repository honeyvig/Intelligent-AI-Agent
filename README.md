# Intelligent-AI-Agent
create innovative AI agents for our growing AI team. The ideal candidate should have experience in designing and developing intelligent agents that can operate autonomously or in collaboration with other systems. Knowledge of machine learning frameworks, natural language processing, and AI ethics is essential. If you are passionate about advancing AI technology and can deliver high-quality solutions, we want to hear from you!
==================
Creating an AI agent that can operate autonomously or in collaboration with other systems requires knowledge in various areas, including machine learning frameworks, natural language processing (NLP), AI ethics, and system design. Below is a Python code outline to help build an intelligent AI agent. This agent will be built using the following components:

    Natural Language Understanding: Using spaCy for NLP.
    Machine Learning Frameworks: Using scikit-learn and TensorFlow for training models.
    Autonomous Agent Framework: Using Rasa (open-source conversational AI framework) for building agents that can interact and process user queries.
    AI Ethics: Placeholder for ethical considerations in AI development.

This project will allow the creation of an intelligent AI agent that can be used autonomously or collaborate with other systems.
Prerequisites:

    Install the following dependencies:

pip install rasa
pip install spacy
pip install tensorflow
pip install scikit-learn
pip install transformers

Python Code for Creating the AI Agent:
1. Define the NLP Model with SpaCy for Text Preprocessing

import spacy

# Load a pre-trained SpaCy model for NLP tasks
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def preprocess_text(text):
    """
    This function preprocesses the text by removing stop words, punctuation,
    and applying lemmatization.
    """
    doc = nlp(text)
    processed_text = " ".join([token.lemma_ for token in doc if not token.is_stop and not token.is_punct])
    return processed_text

# Example usage:
text = "I am building an intelligent AI agent."
processed_text = preprocess_text(text)
print(processed_text)

2. Building the AI Agent Using Rasa (for Conversational AI)

Rasa is an open-source machine learning framework for automated text and voice-based assistants.
Step 1: Create a simple Rasa project:

Run the following command to initialize a new Rasa project:

rasa init --no-prompt

This will generate the necessary folder structure and files for a Rasa bot:

    actions.py: For custom actions.
    domain.yml: Defines intents, actions, and responses.
    data/nlu.yml: Contains training data for NLU.
    stories.yml: Defines how the bot should respond in different scenarios.

Step 2: Example of defining intents and responses:

In domain.yml:

intents:
  - greet
  - goodbye
  - inform

responses:
  utter_greet:
    - text: "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
  utter_goodbye:
    - text: "Goodbye! Have a great day!"
  utter_inform:
    - text: "I am an intelligent AI agent. How can I help you?"

In data/nlu.yml (training data):

version: "2.0"
nlu:
  - intent: greet
    examples: |
      - hello
      - hi
      - hey
  - intent: goodbye
    examples: |
      - goodbye
      - bye
      - see you
  - intent: inform
    examples: |
      - tell me about yourself
      - what can you do

In stories.yml (conversational flow):

version: "2.0"
stories:
  - story: user greets and asks for help
    steps:
      - intent: greet
      - action: utter_greet
  - story: user says goodbye
    steps:
      - intent: goodbye
      - action: utter_goodbye

Step 3: Train the Rasa model:

rasa train

Step 4: Run the Rasa bot:

rasa run

This will start the Rasa server and you can interact with your bot via a REST API.
3. Autonomous Decision-Making (with a Machine Learning Model)

Now, let's integrate a simple ML model for the agent to learn and make decisions based on the data it receives. We will use scikit-learn for creating a simple classifier that can predict the action of the agent based on user input.

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Sample data (User inputs and corresponding labels)
data = [
    ("Hi, how are you?", "greet"),
    ("Goodbye", "goodbye"),
    ("Can you help me with my task?", "inform"),
    ("Hello, what's your name?", "greet"),
    ("Bye, have a nice day", "goodbye")
]

# Extract features and labels
X = [x[0] for x in data]
y = [x[1] for x in data]

# Split the data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Create a simple feature extractor (Bag of Words)
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
X_train_vec = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_vec = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Train a RandomForest Classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train_vec, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate the model
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test_vec)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)}")

# Example of predicting the user's intent
user_input = "Tell me about yourself"
user_input_vec = vectorizer.transform([user_input])
prediction = clf.predict(user_input_vec)
print(f"Predicted Intent: {prediction[0]}")

4. Adding Ethical Considerations (Ethics in AI)

AI Ethics is a critical part of developing intelligent agents. To ensure that the AI agents follow ethical guidelines, you should implement checks for bias in data, ensure fairness in decision-making, and provide transparency in the model's decisions.

For instance, you could log decisions made by the AI agents for audit purposes:

import logging

# Setup logging to track agent's decision
logging.basicConfig(filename='agent_decisions.log', level=logging.INFO)

def log_decision(user_input, predicted_intent):
    logging.info(f"User Input: {user_input}, Predicted Intent: {predicted_intent}")

# Log the decision when a user input is processed
log_decision(user_input, prediction[0])

Step 5: Combine the Components

You can combine all these components into one system where the agent:

    Preprocesses the input (via SpaCy for NLP).
    Classifies the userâ€™s intent (using machine learning).
    Responds accordingly using Rasa for conversational flow.
    Logs decisions for auditing based on ethical AI principles.

Conclusion:

The code above outlines the basic structure for creating an AI agent that can understand natural language, classify intents, and autonomously perform tasks. The agent is extensible, and you can integrate it with various backend systems, NLP pipelines, and conversational agents like Rasa. Ethical considerations can be integrated into the agent by ensuring transparency, fairness, and data logging for auditing decisions.
